In this project hosted by Omdena (https://www.omdena.com/chapter-challenges/local-news-aggregator-and-analyzer-for-kitwe-zambia) the objective was to:

Create a news aggregator and analyzer tailored to news media in Kitwe, Zambia. This project is necessary due to upsurges in online news production and internet usage in Kitwe and the need to have reliable media.

The project follows the classical data science life cycle:

1.) Problem Statement

2.) Data Collection

3.) Data Preparation

4.) Exploratory Data Analysis

5.) Preprocessing

6.) Modeling (implementation of LLM)

7.) Documentation

The group working on this project collaborated on the notebooks in this folder through many meetings over the course of a month and a half.

This project goes to show the value of large language models in the context of media and its economic and political impact.
